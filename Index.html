  <span class="articleHeader hiddenArticle">About us:</span>
    <p>
    <span class="flavorName">Rimini</span> is an Italian inspired Gelateria serving the highest quality gelato, along with a light breakfast and lunch menu,
    beer, wine, and cocktail menu, hand crafted european chocolate line, and the finest experience of a coffeehouse
    with our own line of espresso.
    Our philosophy is "slow food fast" we pride ourselves on everything that is crafted only comes from the highest
    quality ingredients, whether that is organic, local milk, to fresh picked produce for our sorbets, housemade breads
    and pastries, along with fresh scratch soups that have become well sought after in the winter months.
</p>

     <span class="paragraphHeader">Our Gelato</span>
    <p>
    Gelato, generally has half the fat of its American counterpart, ice cream. By using whole milk instead of Heavy cream.
    AT Rimini, we use fresh, local 2% milk from our friends in Boulder, sweetened only with granulated sugar and no
    thing artificial. Sorbetto, being made with water instead of dairy, is strictly flavor based. From the Swiss couveture
    chocolate in our dark chocolate, to the costa rican gold pineapples, if the flavor is not in season somewhere and in its
    ripest perfection, you will not see it in our display case.
    </p>

     <span class="paragraphHeader">Rimini Chocolates</span>
    <p>
    Guittard, Valrhona, Felchlin. The highest quality couveture chocolate in the world is only used in our hand crafted
    chocolate bon bon line. Flavors changing seasonally, gift boxes in sevral sizes are offered both inhouse and shipped
    directly to your door in the the chocolate shipping friendly months of November through April.
    </p>

     <span class="paragraphHeader">Breakfast and Lunch</span>
    <p>
    Served daily eggs, cereal, crepes, charcuterie plate, our popular oatmeal brulee, and fresh yogurt are offered until
    11am.
    Hand made breads hold our signature paninis, sandwiches, soups, salads, or cheese selection to accompany abottle of
    wine after a fulfilling day on the mountains. Dont forget to save room to experience a mug full of Rimini hot
    chocolate. The most decadent meal you will savor in a cup. Using rich european chocolate and whole milk with riminis
    special blend of spices and flavor, served both in white or dark hot chocolate, adding a shot of spiked goodness
    makes for a sweet memory .
    Wine and cocktail bar
    A sweet and savory cafe would not be complete without being able to enjoy a liquid libation while people watching
    on our patio slopeside.
